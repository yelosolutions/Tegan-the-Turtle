# Tegan the Turtle
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use the turtle module to draw a fifty pence shape using Tegan the Turtle. The script allows the user to input the number of shapes to be drawn and the color of the shapes, then it uses turtle to draw the shapes with the desired color.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need to have Python and the turtle module installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Running the script
To run the script, navigate to the project directory and type the following command in the terminal:

### Copy code
```
python fifty_pence.py
```
You will be prompted to enter the number of shapes to be drawn and the color of the shapes. Once you've entered the required information, the script will use turtle to draw the shapes on the screen.

### Customizing the shapes
You can customize the script to draw different shapes or add more features. The script is well commented, and the code is organized and easy to read, so it should be straightforward to make changes.
